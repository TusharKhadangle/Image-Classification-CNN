Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification

This project showcases a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify images into two categories using TensorFlow and Keras. The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional layers that extract important features from the images, followed by pooling layers to reduce dimensionality while retaining the most relevant information. Each convolutional layer uses the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity, enabling the model to learn more complex patterns. After the convolutional and pooling layers, fully connected (dense) layers process the extracted features, ultimately producing a binary classification output through a sigmoid activation function.
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, which adapts the learning rate for efficient convergence, and binary cross-entropy as the loss function, ensuring effective performance on binary classification tasks. The notebook also integrates early stopping to monitor validation loss, halting training when the model shows signs of overfitting. With this setup, the model aims to achieve high accuracy by optimizing its ability to generalize across new, unseen data. Additionally, key metrics like accuracy and loss are tracked to evaluate the model's performance throughout the training process.
