# Image-Classification-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model uses convolutional layers to extract features, pooling for dimensionality reduction, and dense layers for classification. It employs the Adam optimizer and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
